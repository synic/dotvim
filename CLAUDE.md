  # Code Style Guidelines

  * When it comes to adding comments, only add comments if they are
  documentation (docstrings, etc), or because you are describing some code that
  may not be obvious.
  * Do not add useless comments.
  * Always use the style in the file. Do not add trailing spaces.
  * Use conventional commit format
  * Don't sign commits.
