# My VIM Configuration

Most of the configuration is happening for NeoVim at this time, and that
configuration is set up in the lua directory (see `lua/init.lua`). General
configuration like the leader, escape, etc, is still done in `init.vim`.

I've left the configuration that works with VIM there, though I don't work on
it much. It comes in handy when I'm on a system where NeoVim is unavailable.

To install for regular VIM, run the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/synic/dotvim ~/.vim
```

To install for NeoVim, run the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/synic/dotvim ~/.config/nvim
```
